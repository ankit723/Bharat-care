# This is a placeholder for the alarm sound file
# Replace this with an actual alarm.wav audio file
# The file should be a short, attention-grabbing alarm sound
# Recommended format: WAV, 16-bit, 44.1kHz
# Duration: 2-5 seconds (will be looped by the notification service)

# You can download free alarm sounds from:
# - freesound.org
# - zapsplat.com
# - soundbible.com

# Or use a simple beep/alert sound that's recognizable and not too harsh
